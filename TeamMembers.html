							<p><b>Background Information: </b> Nationality: Fijian - Languages Spoken: Fijian, Hindi, English - Hobbies include: Fishing and Golf. <br> I'm interested in IT because I'm extremely interested in learning and excelling at new technologies.

I have many interesting developers that I work with on a day to day basis. Looking at their skills in development has inspired me to study further in IT.</p>

							<p><b>Ideal Job:</b> Software Engineer ( Cybersecurity)</p>
							<p><b><a href="https://himanshu2988.github.io/ITAssignment1/">Assignment One Link</a></b></p>
							<p><b>Background Information: </b> <br> My name is Himanshu Sharma, I am from Melbourne and I have been in the logistics and supply chain industry for over a decade now. I am working as an Operations Manager with a private company which merchandises goods to Bunnings.
							Being in this industry for a long time, I have chosen this course to enhance my skills which would be helpful to deliver better results in terms of organizational profit and growth. I enjoy being a part of the team where you see new challenges every day. Basically, it involves supply planning, product planning, demand planning, sales and operations planning, and supply management.
							I love to play basketball and badminton. Apart from that, I like to go to the gym to keep myself up and running with a daily life schedule. All these activities allow me to interact with my friends and to meet new people.</p>
 						  <p>The reasons for interest in IT are many but the major catch would be the different career paths it allows you to be in and my interest with the technology is one of the reasons. Being in the logistic and supply chain industry for over a decade and seeing the growing use of IT is itself a motivation to get to know the industry a bit more and see what more this world of IT has to offer.</p>
