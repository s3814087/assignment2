							<p><b>Background Information: </b> Nationality: Jijian - Languages Spoken: Fijian, Hindi, English - Hobbies include: Fishing and Golf. <br> I'm interested in IT because I'm extremely interested in learning and excelling at new technologies. I've mastered some programs and languages in my current job as a Tester and want to expand my knowledge in IT and I look forward to mastering more programs as they're developed. I'm also interested in creative problem solving and developing large Application systems. My interest in IT started when I started working in a large organisation in a system team. I have many interesting developers that I work with on a day to day basis. Looking at their skills in development has inspired me to study further in IT.</p>

							<p><b>Background Information: </b> <br> Bribie Island, Australia is where I now call home. I was born in Brisbane raised in a catholic family speaking English and have self-taught Japanese. My education since High School is limited to a Certificate IV in Government Administration and Project Management.

I used to participate in Triathlon for 6 years until I had a cycling accident during a race, causing a back injury. My fitness focus now is strength training and walking my two beautiful dogs along the many beaches Bribie Island has to offer. My favourite pastimes are watching NASA youtube videos, and playing Animal Crossing or Pokémon games on the Nintendo Switch.</p>

							<p><b>Background Information: </b> <br> I was born and raised in Ipswich QLD, where I still live. My family is from Scotland and we are a part of the Clan Gunn. Its origins have a direct descent from Norse people, which explains the red in my beard. I have a Cert IV in Youth Work. After quite a terrifying event I have decided to leave the field and try my hand at something I have a drive for.  I am a musician and have been playing guitar for about 16 years. I love anything fantasy based Swords, dragons, and castles are my jam! My favorite video game franchise is Final Fantasy and I have a few tattoos to dedicate this lifelong love affair.</p>

							<p><b>Student #:</b> S3701796</p>
							<p><b>Ideal Job:</b> Software Engineer ( Cybersecurity)</p>
							<p><b><a href="https://himanshu2988.github.io/ITAssignment1/">Assignment One Link</a></b></p>
							<p><b>Background Information: </b> <br> My name is Himanshu Sharma, I am from Melbourne and I have been in the logistics and supply chain industry for over a decade now. I am working as an Operations Manager with a private company which merchandises goods to Bunnings.
							Being in this industry for a long time, I have chosen this course to enhance my skills which would be helpful to deliver better results in terms of organizational profit and growth. I enjoy being a part of the team where you see new challenges every day. Basically, it involves supply planning, product planning, demand planning, sales and operations planning, and supply management.
							I love to play basketball and badminton. Apart from that, I like to go to the gym to keep myself up and running with a daily life schedule. All these activities allow me to interact with my friends and to meet new people.</p>
 						  <p>The reasons for interest in IT are many but the major catch would be the different career paths it allows you to be in and my interest with the technology is one of the reasons. Being in the logistic and supply chain industry for over a decade and seeing the growing use of IT is itself a motivation to get to know the industry a bit more and see what more this world of IT has to offer.</p>
